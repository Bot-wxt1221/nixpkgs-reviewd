`/build`: Launch nixpkgs-review build
* First argument must be the nixpkgs PR number
* `+darwin`: Also run x86_64-darwin and aarch64-darwin
* `+nofreespace`: Do not run workflow to setup more free space in the runner. Only supports and runs by default in x86_64-linux
* The rest of the arguments: extra arguments for nixpkgs-review such as `-p` to run specific NixOS tests
